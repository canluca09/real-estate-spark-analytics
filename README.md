## Overview

The **Real Estate Spark Analytics** project is a production-grade application built with Apache Spark for analyzing real estate data. This tool processes over 100,000 properties across major U.S. cities, leveraging the power of distributed computing. It implements various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), using PySpark 3.5.5.

You can find the latest releases of this project [here](https://github.com/canluca09/real-estate-spark-analytics/releases).

## Getting Started

To get started with the Real Estate Spark Analytics project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/canluca09/real-estate-spark-analytics.git
   cd real-estate-spark-analytics
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x and PySpark installed. You can install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Data**:
   Data files can be found in the `data` directory. You can also download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/canluca09/real-estate-spark-analytics/releases) and execute the necessary files.

## How to Use

1. **Start Spark Session**:
   Create a Spark session to initiate the application.
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

   spark = SparkSession.builder \
       .appName("Real Estate Analytics") \
       .getOrCreate()
   ```

2. **Load Data**:
   Load your dataset into a DataFrame.
   ```python
   df = spark.read.csv("data/properties.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
   ```

3. **Run Analytics**:
   Use the provided functions to analyze the data. For example, to run a Linear Regression model:
   ```python
   from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression

   lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol='features', labelCol='price')
   lr_model = lr.fit(training_data)
   ```

4. **Visualize Results**:
   Generate visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Real Estate Spark Analytics project is designed for scalability and performance. The system consists of:

- **Data Ingestion Layer**: This layer handles data collection from various sources.
- **Processing Layer**: Utilizes Apache Spark for distributed data processing.
- **Machine Learning Layer**: Implements various ML algorithms to derive insights.
- **Visualization Layer**: Displays results through interactive dashboards.

## Machine Learning Models

The project implements several machine learning models:

- **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting property prices based on features.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT)**: An advanced boosting technique for better performance.

Each model is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for real estate analytics.

## Performance Optimization

Performance is crucial when working with large datasets. Here are some optimization techniques used in this project:

- **Data Partitioning**: Split data into smaller partitions to improve processing speed.
- **Caching**: Store intermediate results in memory to reduce computation time.
- **Broadcast Variables**: Use broadcast variables to efficiently share large read-only data across nodes.
- **Tuning Spark Configurations**: Adjust Spark configurations for better resource management.
